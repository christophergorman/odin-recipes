        <p> Fried Chicken so crispy and crunchy with every bite, you feel like you've gone to the deep south.</p>
        <h3> Step One:</h3>
        <p> After using a mallet and knife to get the breasts cut to good portions you will marinate the chicken in a bowl filled with a brine made of Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder. They must marinate for at least one hour, preferably longer.</p>
        <h3> Step Two:</h3>
        <p> Gather the Bowl, some eggs to make a dredge, and flour and crushed Corn flakes to prepare all the chicken for frying. Take the strips one by one and cover them in the flour, then dip in the dredge, then roll them in the corn flakes and put them aside. When all your strips are ready, you can move onto the frying.</p>
        <h3> Step Three:</h3>
        <p> Heat up Cooking Oil, like vegetable oil, to 350 degrees, then carefully drop in about 3-5 strips at a time. Let them fry for approximately 5 minutes and remove them with tongs and drape them over a cookie sheet to drip off any excess oil.</p>
        <h3> Step Four:</h3>
        <p>Enjoy your chicken strips!</p>
