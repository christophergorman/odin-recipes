        <h1>Chicken Cordon Bleu</h1>
        <img src="https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Easy-Chicken-Cordon-Bleu-2.jpg" alt=" A juicy piece of chicken stuffed with ham and swiss cheese." class="center">
        <p>Chicken stuffed with ham and cheese, coated with crunchy golden breadcrumbs. You’d swear it’s fried – but it’s baked.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Step One:</h3>
        <p>I stuff my Easy Chicken Cordon Bleu simply by cutting a pocket into chicken breast, then stuffing it with cheese rolled up inside ham (helps stop the cheese melting out, terrific reader tip!) . Secure with toothpicks – and that’s it! The stuffing is done!</p>
        <h3> Step Two:</h3>
        <p>Smear mayo and mustard on the chicken, then sprinkle over breadcrumbs. The mayo-mustard mixture acts as glue / flavouring and oil to help make the breadcrumb toasty gold.</p>
        <h3> Step Three:</h3>
        <p>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown and just cooked through. Remove toothpicks, serve with the Dijon Cream Sauce.</p>
